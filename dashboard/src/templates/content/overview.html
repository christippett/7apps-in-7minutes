  <strong>Objectives</strong>
  <ol class="is-upper-roman">
    <li>
      Deploy the same code across all services â€” nothing about the application should be
      particular to any service (or Google Cloud for that matter)
    </li>
    <li>Each application should have its own custom domain</li>
    <li>
      Requests should be served over HTTPS, with SSL/TLS certificates provisioned
      automatically
    </li>
    <li>Deployments should be 100% automated</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Logs from Cloud Build will appear below when a deployment is active.
